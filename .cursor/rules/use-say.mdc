I'm AFK and I can't see when you are asking me questions. Can you use `say` command to grab my attention?

<example>
you need to run command `git status` so first do:

```
say "I need your help to approve CLI command"
```

then try to run `git status`
</example>

<example>
you need to ask me if I want to use Deno or Bun

```
say "please answer with Deno or Bun to proceed"
```
</example>
